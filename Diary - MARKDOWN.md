1.Social Disconnection Across Distances
	Issue: In today’s globalized world, many people live far away from their friends and family due to work, education, or other commitments. Physical activities and social games that bring people together in person are often unavailable across distances.
	Example: Friends in different countries or cities find it challenging to stay connected through meaningful shared activities beyond simple text or video calls.


2. Limited Interactive Solutions for Long-Distance Engagement
	Issue: Existing virtual engagement tools (e.g., online games or video calls) often lack physical involvement or deeper emotional connection. They fail to mimic the bonding experience of shared physical activities like sports.


3. Golf as a Missed Opportunity for Long-Distance Social Play
	Issue: Golf, which is traditionally a sport promoting social interaction and relaxation, is inaccessible for long-distance play. This is especially true in countries like Sri Lanka, where golf courses and infrastructure are scarce, and playing in person is a luxury.
	
4. Post-Pandemic Social Distancing Mindset
	Issue: Even as the pandemic has subsided, the habit of maintaining physical distance persists in many contexts, making it hard for people to engage in sports and physical activities that require in-person interaction.



Problem Synthesis:
“How can we create an engaging and interactive platform that allows friends and family across different locations to connect and play together, fostering meaningful interaction and physical activity, while overcoming the barriers of distance, cost, and accessibility?”
